		"Advocacy": "Poverty is a barrier to life-saving health care and health knowledge, whether it be through lack of income and/or access to materials. Barriers like these are meant to be overcome. We at Project LAAN believe this can be done through our advocacy of public health.    Given the current COVID-19 pandemic, where health is at the center of attention, it is important for individuals to have general knowledge of public health, for communities to be aware and assert their rights on health, and for society to uplift one another in times of need through this knowledge.     As Project LAAN approaches its 10th year as an organization, the journey towards universal health coverage has just begun. Through public health advocacy, health literacy, and patient empowerment, we can achieve a reality where health is for all without any form of burden. This is how we fight poverty for the families we serve by giving our all for health.",
